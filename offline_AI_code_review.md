Here are two possible approaches to have an offline LLM review your code locally on your workstation:

**1. Locally Hosted LLM with Integration:**

* **Concept:** This approach involves setting up a locally hosted, offline LLM model that can be integrated with your development workflow for code review.
* **Requirements:**
    * **Hardware Resources:** Running an LLM locally requires significant computing resources (CPU, GPU, memory). Ensure your workstation has sufficient power to handle the model's needs.
    * **Technical Expertise:** Setting up and integrating an LLM can be complex and requires technical knowledge of machine learning and potentially coding skills.
* **Steps:**
    1. **Choose Offline LLM:**  Research and choose an offline LLM model suitable for code review. Some options include:
        * **Hermes 13b GPT-Q:** [https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/) (smaller model, easier to run)
        * **WizardCoder-15B-GPTQ:** [https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/) (larger model, potentially more powerful)
    2. **Install and Configure:** Follow the model's specific instructions for local installation and configuration. This might involve setting up Python libraries, downloading pre-trained weights, and potentially configuring hardware acceleration.
    3. **Develop Integration (Optional):** Depending on your workflow, explore ways to integrate the LLM with your code editor or IDE. This could involve creating custom scripts or using existing plugins that facilitate code analysis using external tools.

**2. Pre-Trained Code Analysis Models:**

* **Concept:** This approach leverages pre-trained code analysis models designed specifically for tasks like code review or bug detection. These models are often smaller and less resource-intensive than full LLMs. 
* **Requirements:**
    * **Finding Suitable Models:**  Research open-source pre-trained code analysis models or libraries that can be used locally for code review. Some options include:
        * **CodeCarbonCopy - Detecting Code Duplicates:** [https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon)
        * **InferSent - Sentence Embeddings for Code:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10464](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10464) (more for code similarity than review)
    * **Technical Knowledge:**  While generally easier than a full LLM, you might still need some technical knowledge to install and use these models.
* **Steps:**
    1. **Choose Code Analysis Model:** Research and choose a pre-trained code analysis model that aligns with your needs. 
    2. **Install and Run:**  Follow the model's instructions for installation and running it locally. This might involve using Python libraries and providing your code as input.
    3. **Interpret Results:** The model may provide outputs like potential code smells, areas for improvement, or similarity detection depending on its specific functionality. Analyze the results to identify areas for code review or improvement.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Capabilities:** Both approaches have limitations compared to human code review. They might identify potential issues but lack the full context and reasoning of a developer. 
* **Computational Resources:**  Even pre-trained models might require some processing power. Ensure your workstation can handle the workload.
* **Maintenance:**  Keeping the LLM or code analysis model updated with the latest versions might require ongoing maintenance.

**Alternative Approaches:**

* **Linters and Static Code Analysis Tools:** Consider using linters or static code analysis tools specifically designed for your programming language. These are often lightweight and can identify potential errors or stylistic issues as a first step in code review.
* **Cloud-Based LLM Services:** Explore cloud-based services that offer LLM functionalities, potentially including code review capabilities. These might be a good option if you lack the resources for a local setup.

The best approach depends on your technical expertise, hardware resources, and desired level of functionality. Consider the trade-offs between ease of use, computational resources, and the specific code review capabilities offered by each option.
